# Code1-C_Plus 

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving. 

I created a software that can read files, and write the read data into a new backup file. The read information will be sorted by how many times it appears as a string, which can be printed out by a one item search, or with all items being printed out at once. Printing all items can be done through a histogram or simple numbers, depending on which option you choose. There is a menu with four options: the first being a single search, print all items with the number of times it appears, print all items with a histogram, and lastly a quit option. All these options are selectable with 1 through 4. This software solves the problem of quickly sorting through data in text files, so data can be quickly read and understood by a user. 

# What did you do particularly well? 

I think the object-oriented part of the software was the part I had written the best, compared to the rest of the code. The software is made so that variables used for input or output can be used across the entire program, with the exception of main, I was able to make so it was easy to edit and use the various functions. 

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on? 

I could write the code to be a little more flexible, like making it so it was possible to select files with main, instead of having to change the file within the software itself, improving efficency. Another improvement I could make is to manage the memory better with smart or manual pointers, which would make the code more secure. 

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network? 

The most challenging part of the code was figuring out what variables I wanted to be public, and the full scope of the software. I found that the naming convention was, at times, harder than expected. This was because I had to figure out how to make the name represent the assigned data and have proper conventions when naming objects versus a general variable. This was my first time using Microsoft Visual Studio, and I am quite happy with using it as a tool, with how easy it was to organize the software pieces. I also used headers to make it easier to quickly look at what functions existed and make the code more readable when I did not need to know the exact details. For resources, I found w3schools to be a good source for an overview of what I am using, for example, understanding the imported map so I could assign a string with a number. 

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work? 

The biggest skill I can transfer from this project is object-oriented programming, as that is extremely useful for making code that is easy to read. I benefit from using the skill of making code into different files, for sorting by purpose and use, as this is important for object-oriented programming and readability. 

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 

I used object-oriented programming to separate and sort the software into maintainable, readable, and adaptable parts. This helped me to make it so different parts of the software could be quickly adjusted or changed, and potentially rewritten with a new object through overwriting a function. I also found that private variables could be used for all functions, without being exposed to the main software operation, making it easier to write code in the future without too much repeat writing. The software was split into two files, so it was easier to read and maintain. Using the header was helpful in making the program easier to read, while also only using one header file for the two other program files.
